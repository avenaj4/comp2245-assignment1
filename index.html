        <p>My name is Avena Joseph and I am currently pursuing studies in Information Technology. I enjoy learning new technologies and exploring how programming can be used to solve real-world problems. Outside of academics, I am creative and curious, always looking for opportunities to grow my skills and challenge myself. Iâ€™m especially interested in web development and design and I look forward to building projects that combine both technical and creative elements.</p>

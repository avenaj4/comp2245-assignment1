      I’m Avena Joseph, an IT student who enjoys solving problems and creating clean, user-friendly interfaces.
    Web Development interests me because it blends creativity with logic—I get to design how a page looks while
    also making it work smoothly behind the scenes. I’m excited to keep learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I
    can build real projects that are useful, accessible, and enjoyable to use.
